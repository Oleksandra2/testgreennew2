For end users to view the app in runtime, you must assign the app to a role. Any end user who is a member of this role will be able to access the app. In this tutorial, we use the `Everyone` role.  You also need to assign the app to a group so that it's visible in the Launchpad page.

This is described in the following steps.


### Assign the app to the Everyone role


In this step, you'll assign the **Everyone** role to your app.

>Content assigned to the **Everyone** role is visible to all users.

1. Go back to the Content Manager and click the **Everyone** role.

    ![Click Everyone role](8-everyone-role.png)

4. In the **Results** list, click + to assign this role to your app:
